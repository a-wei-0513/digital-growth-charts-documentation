Get Started
Looking to integrate? You need the Swagger/OpenAPI3 API documentation.
Clinical queries about the thought process, design decisions, and clinical assurance? Go to our clinical documentation.
Want to play with the server locally, test, and develop? You want our developer documentation. Note that if you run your own server that you are entirely responsible for clinically assuring that it returns correct values.

Award Winning
The RCPCH was proud to win 'Best Health Tech Solution in the Health Tech Awards 2020 for the Growth Charts API. It was really heartening to see infrastructural projects like ours being recognised as the building blocks of incredible future clinical interfaces.

Gold Standard
Working with the UK's top experts in growth monitoring, growth charts, centile and SDS calculation, and child development, we've created an API that takes away the heavy lifting of calculating child growth parameters. You get reliable, safe results instantly.

Demo clients & tools
To help you implement the API we've built demo clients and tools to help with charting. These are all open source and permissively licensed to allow code reuse in your application without affecting the Intellectual Property rights of your developed solution.
