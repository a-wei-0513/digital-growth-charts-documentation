# DISCLAIMER

!!! warning
    **TL;DR: Don't self host in production. Use our warranted API**. 
    
    The only version of the dGC API which is warranted to be correct for clinical use is that which is served by the RCPCH itself from our API endpoint at <https://api.rcpch.ac.uk>.
    While we have, for transparency equity-of-access and safety reasons, made it _possible_ to use our open source code to set up a server providing dGC API calculations, we specifically and strongly advise _against_ doing this, except for testing, verification, or development purposes.
    
    You must understand and accept that any version of this API running **outside** our controlled environment must be:
    
    - Independently **clinically** assured for safety.
  
    - Independently **technically** verified for safe and correct deployment.

    - Independently registered as a Medical Device with the MHRA and EU MDR, with Declaration of Conformity.

    - For NHS use it would also need to undergo all relevant DCB0129 and DCB0160 certification with NHS Digital under your organisation's Safety Policy, and there would be a requirement to appoint a named, suitably qualified Clinical Safety Officer.
