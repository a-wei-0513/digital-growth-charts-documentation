# The RCPCHGrowth package

The calculations are all performed in the RCPCHGrowth package. This is a dependency of the API but developers that want to include it in their projects independently are free to use the package themselves. It can be found on [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/rcpchgrowth/).

To add to your project:

```bash
pip install rcpchgrowth
```

If you want to contribute to the project, you will need clone the [repository](https://github.com/rcpch/rcpchgrowth-python) and create a python environment based on 3.8.3:

```bash
pyenv virtualenv 3.8.3 rcpch-growth-python
```
