# FAQs for Developers

## Q: Where is all your dGC code?

**A**: All the code for all our Digital Growth Chart work is publicly available on GitHub, in the `rcpch` organisation. See <https://github.com/rcpch>

## Q: Why did you build the API in Python?

**A**: - Python has become the de-facto language of the scientific and bioinformatics communities.

- Most of the packages we needed were '1st party' ie maintained by the PSF

- We think it's a nice language to use.

- It's accessible to clinicians who want to learn to code, and it's easy enough to learn that it's taught in schools.

- It has everything we needed for building an API and web layers we needed.
