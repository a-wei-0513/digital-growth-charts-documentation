# Making calls to the dGC API

There are as many ways to make an API call as there are software developers, I reckon. But here are some common ways. We'll start with using our actual API documentation, then try a super-simple tool called `cURL` but if you would prefer a graphical toll, then feel free to skip ahead to the section on Postman.

## Swagger API documentation

Because we've specified our API documentation in the openAPI3 (formerly known as 'Swagger') format, we can auto-generate documentation for our API, but not only that, the documentation is interactive and lets you actually make calls.


## Using cURL

`cURL` is a very simple and common tool for making web calls from the command line (also known as the 'terminal' or 'command prompt')

Download cURL from here

```bash

```
