# Server and API Technical Information

# API

The API is written in Python.

Mathematical and statistical calculations are made using the [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/) and [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) libraries. [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) and [Xlrd](https://pypi.org/project/xlrd/) are used for data analysis.

Server middleware used is [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/quickstart/).

We use the Microsoft Azure API Management Platform to handle authorization, rate limits and quotas.
