## 

The RCPCH Digital Growth Charts (dGC) Project consists of:

* API Server which returns Growth Chart Calculations over REST
  
* Demonstration Client in React.js which shows the main features of the API and serves as 'living documentation' of the standard chart view [growth.rcpch.ac.uk](https://growth.rcpch.ac.uk)

* React.js Chart component, which can be used in third-party applications to reduce the work involved in displaying a standard chart.
  
* Clinical Safety Management File for the deployment of the API at [api.rcpch.ac.uk](https://api.rcpch.ac.uk)

API documentation can be found at [dev.rcpch.ac.uk](https://dev.rcpch.ac.uk)

This is the main documentation for all parts of the project, including our clinical risk documentation.
